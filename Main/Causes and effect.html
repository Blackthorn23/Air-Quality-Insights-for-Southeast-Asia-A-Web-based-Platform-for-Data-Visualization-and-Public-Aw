            <h3>Deforestation and Agricultural Practices</h3>
            <p> Deforestation and certain agricultural practices, such as slash-and-burn farming and the use of
                chemical fertilizers, contribute to air pollution. Deforestation reduces the natural ability of
                forests to absorb carbon dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change.
                Additionally, agricultural activities release pollutants like ammonia (NH3) and volatile
                organic compounds (VOCs) into the atmosphere, impacting air quality and posing risks to human
                health.
